            One of my favorite inspiring stories about travel takes place in Cuba. I visited Cuba in February 2013 and it changed my life — and I like to think it did so for the better. Interestingly, I expected a completely different country and was compelled to write about it when I got back home.
            But let me tell you more.Bad trips can last as long as good ones, and there’s no way to stop the trip once it begins. You can expect the effects to linger for up to 24 hours after the bad trip begins. Tolerance. Tolerance to acid develops quickly.
